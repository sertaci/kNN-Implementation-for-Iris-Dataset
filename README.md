This repository is an improved version of an assignment in the CENG463 course that I took at the university. 

In this notebook, there is a process that I implemented knn Classifier without using the functions of the sklearn library for the iris dataset. 
I also defined a variable called test_ratio. This variable ensures that the data reserved for the test is again divided at a certain rate and in randomness. 
Then I checked the accuracy values of the system according to the change of this assigned test_ratio variable. 
I also observed the computation times changing according to the changing k and test_ratio values.
