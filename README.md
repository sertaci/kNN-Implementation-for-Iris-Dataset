# kNN Implementation from Scratch

This repository is an improved version of an assignment in the CENG463 course that we took at the university. 

In this notebook, there is a process that we implemented kNN-Classifier from scratc.
We also defined a variable called test_ratio. This variable ensures that the data reserved for the test is again divided at a certain rate and in randomness.
